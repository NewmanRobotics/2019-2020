## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.

## To start development...
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/NewmanRobotics/2019-2020.git`
2. Switch to your own branch (so that way you will not accidentally overwriting other's work): `git checkout -b {yourName}`
3. Begin developing now! I suggest you to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to develop the app.
4. Once you've finishing developing a feature, do `git commit -a -m "{commitMessage}"`, which in this command:
    - `commit`: it creates a commit
    - `-a`: [stage](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git) all the files you've changed
    - `-m`: attach a commit message to your commit
    - `{commitMessage}`: in here please briefly describe (in about 7-10 words) what have you done
5. After committing your change, now use `git push` to push your change to GitHub.
    - You might see something like `fatal: The current branch {branchName} has no upstream branch.` That's because you have to set the upstream destination of the current branch in order to let `git` know where the remote branch is. If you see this, just run the command it provided to you, and in all further times you can just use `git push` as you'll normally do.
